I want to build a simple music player with Python for learning.

I can use Pygame for this.
First I create a command line program.
When this works I want to do a version with Tkinter.

Done:
- Have a command line program, with that I can make a certain music file 
start playing. 
- Have a Menu to choose the later button functions from
- Play funtion, Stop function, Load song function
- Let the program show information on the file name and if it is playig or not.
- Then add the stop function, so I can always start and stop the music.
- Add a Pause function to make it stop in the middle of the Song, and add an 
unpause function.

Todo next:
 - Info on length of the song.
 - Make it show how long the song is playing with a timer.
 - Let user choose a music file to play.
 
 - Have a song list, that plays one song after the other.
 - Let the user load a whole list of songs.
 - Choose a song from this list to play.
 
 - Create User Interface with Tkinter
